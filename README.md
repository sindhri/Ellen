# Ellen Hoffman fish data aggregation

The following two pipeline lines work:

Individualdata ---> calculate_zscore ---> average_after_zscore ---> avgz_to_clustergram

splitmean ---> calculate_zscore_burst ---> average_after_zscore ---> avgz_to_clustergram

This one needs more work:

splitmean ---> calculate_zscore ---> average_after_zscore ---> avgz_to_clustergram

## calculate_zscore.m
Input type 1: Jeff's pipeline (usualy named 'individualData_xxxxxxxx.csv')

Output: calculate the z-score of experimental fish plate based on the mean and standard deviation of the wild type fish of the same day

Input type 2: The one off burst file generated by Jeff (named 'scn1lab_rw_split_means.csv')

Output: calculate the z-score of experimental fish plate based on the mean and standard deviation of the wild type fish of the same day, TO DO: removed burct and burur coloumns because there are too many infs

## calculate_zscore_burst.m
Input: The one off burst file generated by Jeff (named 'scn1lab_rw_split_means.csv')

Output: calculate zscore of the burst variable (burct and burur), but use wild type from all days because each single given day the fish may not have any burst activity.

## average_after_zscore.m
Input: calculated z score from the above 'calculate_zscore.m' and 'calculate_z_score_burst.m'
Trim the file so only HOM types are left

Average across fish, also aggregate across activities

Output1: mean_by_geno. The parameter/activities are averaged acrossed fish for each geno
If it is not the bust file, also export the aggregated zscore:  
Output2: _averaged. The parameter/activities are aggregated to rms and mean for each group, bout, activity, sleep, all

## avgz_to_clustergram.m
Use the mean_by_geno to generate a clustergram.

Use customer color my_colormap. Replaced the underscores in the labels with space.

## From Raw score for pre and post experiments to geno_by_time plot
* pre_post.m, process the pre and post data files (converted in excel format) and geno text file.
* plot_geno_by_time.m, use the output from the pre_post and make geno_by_time plots, saved in a 'plots' folder
* script_pre_post_analysis.m, a script that uses function pre_post and plot_geno_by_time, so that you can start from selecting the pre and post data file (in excel format), and geno text file, and the script would automatically generate geno_by_time plots.
